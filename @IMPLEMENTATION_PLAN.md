## Recent Session Updates

### Feb 1, 2026 - Analytics Candidates Sub-Feature Migration Complete ✅
**Completed:**
- Successfully migrated analytics/candidates sub-feature (8 endpoints) from Elysia + TypeBox to Hono + Zod
- All candidate-related routes now use Hono patterns with proper Zod validation
- Complex filtering and matching logic preserved during migration
- Significant progress on Analytics feature overall (44% complete)
- Progress: 11.5 of ~22 features complete (52%)

**Endpoints Migrated:**
- GET /api/analytics/candidates/fetch-all
- GET /api/analytics/candidates/find-match
- GET /api/analytics/candidates/match-media
- POST /api/analytics/candidates/match-media-batch
- GET /api/analytics/candidates/suggested-titles
- GET /api/analytics/candidates/by-id/:id
- POST /api/analytics/candidates/confirm
- DELETE /api/analytics/candidates/:id

**Status:**
- ✅ Analytics candidates fully migrated to Hono + Zod
- 🔄 Analytics feature 44% complete (8 of ~18 endpoints)
- ⏭️ Continue with remaining analytics endpoints or tackle Tags/Library features

---

### Feb 1, 2026 - Reddit Automation Migration Complete ✅
**Completed:**
- Successfully migrated reddit-automation feature (11 endpoints) from Elysia + TypeBox to Hono + Zod
- All routes now use Hono patterns with `.json()` returns
- Request/response schemas converted to Zod validators
- Tests updated to use Hono test patterns
- Progress: 11 of ~22 features complete (50%)

**Status:**
- ✅ Reddit automation fully migrated to Hono + Zod
- ⏭️ Major remaining work: Tags (17 endpoints) and Analytics (18 endpoints)

---

### Feb 1, 2026 - Server Validation Complete ✅
**Completed:**
- Fixed all remaining TypeScript errors in server:
  - analytics/operations/fetch-fansly-data.ts - converted unknown credentials to strings
  - analytics/schemas/analytics.ts - replaced Zod MediaSchema import with inline TypeBox schema
  - reddit-automation/operations/generation/utils.ts - added type assertions for eligibleMediaFilter
  - reddit-automation/reddit-poster.ts - added type assertions for eligibleMediaFilter
  - content-schedules/operations/generate-virtual-posts.ts - created proper VirtualPostSchema with all required properties
  - pipeline/routes.test.ts - corrected import type declarations

**FINAL STATUS:**
- ✅ bun lint: PASSING (0 errors)
- ✅ bun typecheck (server): PASSING (0 errors)
- ✅ bun test (server): ALL TESTS PASSING (162 pass, 3 skip)
  - 3 skipped tests are expected (pipeline waiting for migration)

**Note:** Web app still has TypeScript errors related to migrating from Elysia TypeBox `.static` to Zod `z.infer<typeof Schema>`. This is expected and will be fixed when completing the migration.

### Feb 1, 2026 - Test Migration & Lint Fixes
**Completed:**
- Fixed all test files still using Elysia patterns to use Hono:
  - settings/routes.test.ts
  - shoots/routes.test.ts
  - snippets/routes.test.ts
  - filter-presets/routes.test.ts
  - hashtags/routes.test.ts
  - posts/routes.test.ts
- Replaced all `.static` TypeBox references with proper Zod `z.infer<typeof Schema>`:
  - filter-presets/validation.ts
  - reddit-automation/operations/generation/utils.ts
  - hashtags/operations/hashtag-stats/increment-views.ts
  - pipeline/operations/assign-media.ts
  - snippets/routes.test.ts
- Fixed all lint errors - **bun lint now PASSING**
- Reduced typecheck errors from 145 to 42 (mostly expected migration errors in unmigrated features)

**COMMITS:**
- 05a1f31: Fix test files and Zod type inference patterns
- 94411e9: Fix library test: add empty JSON body to POST request

## Next Priority

**Recommended:** Continue with Library/Media, Pipeline, or Postpone features before tackling major features (Tags/Analytics)

### Remaining Feature Migrations

1. **Library/Media** (~11 endpoints) - media management
2. **Pipeline** (3 endpoints) - caption queue
3. **Postpone** (4 endpoints) - postpone management
4. **Tags** (17 endpoints) - dimensions/definitions CRUD ⭐ MAJOR FEATURE
5. **Analytics** (18 endpoints) - complex candidate matching ⭐ MAJOR FEATURE
6. **Infrastructure** - core setup/utilities
7. ~5 other features to be identified

## Key Learnings

- Entity schemas use Zod, while API request/response schemas remain TypeBox
- Route registration requires explicit `.use()` calls in index.ts
- Hono uses `.json()` return pattern vs Elysia's direct returns
- TypeORM entities unchanged; only route handlers need migration
